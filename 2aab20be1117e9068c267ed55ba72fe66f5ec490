      "message": "The loot rewards don\u0027t match up with you evidence. The wiki says the first one gives a damage stim C, the second a damage stim B and the third a damage stim A. However, the allakhazam guide lists the reward for each one as \"Randomized Damage Stimpacks\". A comment below the guide says he got 2 damage stim Cs.\n\nIt sounds to me like when the guide says randomized, it\u0027s not just meaning the stats, but what type of damage stim. I would make just one loot group that has all damage stimpack varieties as possibilities with equal weighting. Then use that loot group for the reward in each of vurlene\u0027s missions.",
