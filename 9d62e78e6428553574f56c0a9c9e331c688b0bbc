I\u0027m not sure who wrote that ToDo, or when, but i interpreted that as a need to make the msg customized (since the cover doesn\u0027t really \"fail\" persay, it\u0027s just that players don\u0027t have enough ACTION to execute it.  Unfortunately there isn\u0027t a similar existing SOE string msg, although i did consider using: string/en/performance.stf\t49\teffect_too_tired\tYou are too tired to execute this special effect. )",
