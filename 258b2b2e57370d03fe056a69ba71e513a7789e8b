For example, I believe that diseases should have all 9 attributes possible but that poisons and fires should only have the three primary attributes possible. You probably need to add some logic to only choose appropriate attributes based upon which dot type is selected.",

What you are saying about the Poison part makes sense to me, since I don\u0027t think there were substat poisons for CM charges. I just did it this way, but yes it can definately be changed to make it more accurate.",
