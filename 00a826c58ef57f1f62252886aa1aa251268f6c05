If we ever change crafting so that station effectiveness matters, we wouldn\u0027t want some old droid stations with a 500 effectiveness floating around (since the normal range on stations is -45 to 45).\n\nCraftingStation\u0027s constructor sets them to 25 initially. I would just leave them at that. You can include this line, but comment it out for now until you\u0027re getting the number from the sceno.",
