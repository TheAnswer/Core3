## Before you can start the server you must build (compile) the code base.
##
## In the EmuYoda interface hit the [BUILD] button and go grab a beer while the server compiles.
##
## When the compile is complete you can hit [START] to run the server.
##
## To login to the server follow the directions on the EmuYoda "Get Connected" page.
