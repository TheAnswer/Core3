You may copy and distribute such a system following the terms of the 
GNU LGPL for Engine3 and the licenses of the other code concerned, 
provided that you include the source code of that other code when

to grant this special exception for their modified versions; 
it is their choice whether to do so. The GNU Lesser General Public License
