Linking Engine3 statically or dynamically with other modules

You may copy and distribute such a system following the terms of the 
GNU LGPL for Engine3 and the licenses of the other code concerned, 
provided that you include the source code of that other code when 
and as the GNU LGPL requires distribution of source code.
 
Note that people who make modified versions of Engine3 are not obligated 
to grant this special exception for their modified versions; 
it is their choice whether to do so. The GNU Lesser General Public License

this exception also makes it possible to release a modified version
