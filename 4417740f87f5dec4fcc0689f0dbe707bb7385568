      "message": "This shouldn\u0027t have a custom name according to the screenshot on the wiki.\n\nEven though the screenshot on the wiki is post-CU, it shows different values for the stats from the scrapbook guide. While other things might have changed, I doubt they would have modified this obscure quest reward\u0027s uses remaining as part of the CU. I believe that means it didn\u0027t have static stats but had a range of stats that it could drop with. You can use a craftingValues table here in the loot item template to setup the ranges.",
