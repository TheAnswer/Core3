      "message": "This isn\u0027t correct. Every creo has a weapon (which is their currently equipped weapon, and the one you have here) and every ai has a vector of weapons they can choose from. You\u0027ll need to look through that vector and see if any of the weapons are a ranged weapon (weapon-\u003egetAttackType() \u003d\u003d WeaponObject::RANGEDATTACK). I\u0027d probably add the functionality as a hasRangedWeapon() method to AiAgent and call it here.",
