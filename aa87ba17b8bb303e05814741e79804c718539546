      "message": "Ok, so this should ignore everything except what goes into the Combat Queue now. I also had to reduce the delay time you added in because with it functioning now as a proper queue the abilities will hang just a bit before firing due to the added delay.\n\nThis also happens onFail, it still adds a small delay before removing the failed command. The delay does seem to still be enough to prevent the prior issue from happening.",
