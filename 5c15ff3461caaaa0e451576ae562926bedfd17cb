      "message": "Of the 3 options I mentioned in my comment on the last patch set, I think the one you are currently using is the least likely to be correct. I highly doubt people had to meditate at the shrine twice after completing their last trial to get their unlock.\n\nIf you can\u0027t find info one way or the other, at least change it to one of the other methods: unlock when the last trial completes OR unlock the first time meditating at the shrine after completing the last trial (which would mean either setting the progression screenplay state when the last trial is completed or moving the unlock call to right here so it happens the same time the state is set).",
