LuaCreatureObject does inherit LuaSceneObject and calling that method with a creo works in practice.\n\nI suspect that busted isn\u0027t aware of that inheritance and is throwing the error because LuaCreatureObject doesn\u0027t have a method named getObjectID. I have no idea what we\u0027d need to do to rectify that (if it is, in fact, the case).",
