If a character starts to harvest, but before run is called the creature dies, goes out of range, gets attacked, or doesn\u0027t have DNA, it will set the faction to 0 when it might have some faction, which can be exploited.\n\nSame thing for PvpBitmask. I think this is a bug in the current code and can be exploited.",
