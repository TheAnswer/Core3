      "message": "It is commented out since the normal structures has a wider area around cities where they cannot be built compared to camps. The isBuildingPermittedAt method checks for normal structures and thus has the wider area around the cities.\n\nIf I remember correctly you could build camps as soon as you left the city, i.e. when you got the message \u0027You have left Coronet\u0027 but building other structures were limited another city radius.",

      "message": "Loshult: I\u0027ve found many references to not being able to build a camp in no-build zones.  Additionally this is related to Mantis 3516 where there are literally they have 400+ entries they\u0027re adding and mostly because you can build a camp on top of them.\n\nAdditionally all the searches I find say you have to be 1000m outside of major cities etc.  I also never recall being able to build a camp near player cities etc.  Do have a reference somewhere that says this should be different?  Either way if we had a isCampPermittedAt how would we populate that?  I guess we could stub it but I can tell you the QA team wants to add a bunch of no-builds that could easily be avoided with this change.",
