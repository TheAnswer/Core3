      "message": "Should you do something in the case of a full inventory? Alternately you could pass true as a 4th arg and it will add it anyway and overload inventory.\n\nAlthough, the cpp shrine component has a check before creating the robe @jedi_spam:inventory_full_jedi_robe. Since there\u0027s a message for full inventory, you should use it and not overload.\n\nYou will then need to also add a way for the player to get a robe if their inventory was full, or just put the inventory check before everything else. Though if I recall correctly there was a way to use a shrine to get a new robe in case a jedi lost/destroyed theirs somehow so you probably need to add that anyway (or was that just something we did in the emu?).",

Mostly, I don\u0027t like that it has a chance to fail to find a trainer.\n\nInstead of this loop that gets a random zone (which could be unlucky and get a space zone or one of the test zone 40 times, etc.) and then a random trainer type, I think we should build a list of all potential trainers across the galaxy and then randomly choose one from that list.\n\nSo you\u0027ll want a trainers vector and two nested for loops. The outer loop is to go through the zones and the inner to loop through trainerTypes. Inside the inner one you\u0027ll have your call to getPlanetaryObjectList() where you simply addAll() it\u0027s return to your trainers vector.\n\nAfter you have your trainers vector, add a while loop that gets a random one and repeats if it fails the checks (it\u0027s a player city trainer, etc.) and ends once it has a good one.\n\nIf you want, you could even pre-build a list of zones that have the trainers instead of looping through all of them, but it\u0027s probably not a big deal either way.",
