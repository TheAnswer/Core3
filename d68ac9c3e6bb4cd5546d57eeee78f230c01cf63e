Looking at where it\u0027s used, and reading the relevant string, I think they should be used when a new election has started and victor is the incumbant (won the previous election).\n\nTherefore, after checking that it\u0027s phase 1, you need to check the election winner (you aren\u0027t deleting that data when switching back to phase 1, which is good for this). If the election winner was victor, return true. It doesn\u0027t matter how a person voted previously (which is what I\u0027m guessing you were going for here).",
