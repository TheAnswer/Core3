      "message": "You\u0027re rolling a new mission number here but not setting it on the MissionObject (it\u0027s set prior to this). Though now that I look closer, it\u0027s not used for recon missions so it probably doesn\u0027t matter.\n\nHowever, the rebel string file includes 50 missions as well. I think it would be best to have each case roll it\u0027s own randTexts then you can setMissionNumber after the switch block.\n\nAlso, please fix the tabbing.",
