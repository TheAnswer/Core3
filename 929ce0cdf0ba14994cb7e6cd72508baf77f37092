If not, I\u0027d rather you avoid hard coding custom messages whenever possible and use a client string if a sufficient one is available. I don\u0027t know what message was sent on live, but you could use base_player:prose_revoke_xp. If we find evidence later that a different string was used, we can update it.",

I was unable to find any tangible evidence of this, however, and I did not see any pictures of it in the Project Screenshots on Google Drive.  Thus, it is only hearsay.  Shall I change it to a client string, or just leave it as is?",
