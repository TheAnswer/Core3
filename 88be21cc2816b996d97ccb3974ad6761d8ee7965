I don\u0027t want to do allot of work if I don\u0027t have to, which is why I check if we\u0027re even in any kind of building first (via the getParentID()).\n\nI didn\u0027t want to pollute building logic inside of the command, but just instead verify that the player can issue the command successfully or not, and then let the building itself decide if its valid or not to acknowledge and process the command.  This way you have a clean delineation of processing.  Also, when the user exits a building, they are auto-unregistered, and that happens from the building logic as well.\n\nAnd I need to know what skills they have, because it is a requirement as to if they can issue the command or not (Medics cannot, Doctors can).\n\nMy preference would be to leave this as is.",
