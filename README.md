# SWGEmu Core3: Recreating the Classic Star Wars Galaxies Experience

## What is SWGEmu?

Star Wars Galaxies (SWG) was an immensely popular massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) introduced by Sony Online Entertainment in 2003. Despite its eventual shutdown in 2011, SWG left a lasting legacy in the hearts of thousands of players.

The SWGEmu project aims to recapture the magic of the game by focusing on a specific milestone: Pre-CU, or Pre-Combat Upgrade. The Combat Upgrade introduced significant changes to the gameplay, which were met with disapproval by many devoted players. It was in response to these changes that the SWGEmu project was bornâ€”a collective effort to "recreate" the game as it existed during the Pre-CU era.

At the core of the SWGEmu project lies the "Emulator," referring to the meticulously crafted server software being developed by the SWGEmu team. This Emulator endeavors to faithfully mimic Sony Online Entertainment's server-side software, which once hosted the immersive galaxies of Star Wars Galaxies during the Pre-CU era. To achieve this ambitious goal, the SWGEmu team has dedicated countless hours to reverse-engineering the code from scratch. They have built their own custom engine and core game logic, ensuring that every detail is crafted with love and precision.

The SWGEmu project is not only a nostalgic journey for passionate players but also a testament to the dedication and perseverance of a talented team. By resurrecting the Pre-CU era, SWGEmu offers an opportunity for both veterans and newcomers to experience the rich and captivating universe of Star Wars Galaxies, as it was once cherished by thousands of fans.

## Docker Build

If you have docker (i.e. Linux docker daemon, Windows/MacOS [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)) you can run the entire development environment and server in a container.

### Setup

The docker build creates a container that includes everything needed to run the core3 engine except you need the tre files from the client.

The setup assumes you've copied your tre files to the docker volume 'shared-tre' and in the container they're mounted in /tre/

On linux or macos you can easily create this volume by doing:

```
$ cd ~/SWGEmu
$ tar cf - *.tre | docker run -i --rm -v shared-tre:/tre debian:bullseye bash -c 'tar xvf - -C /tre'
bottom.tre
...
patch_sku1_14_00.tre
```

The docker container will use these files for your server in the container.

### Build

To build the container:

```
cd docker
./build.sh
```

### Develop/Run

Run the container with:

```
cd docker
./run.sh
```

This runs the container and starts and interactive shell, in there you can work with the code (workspace/Core3), build and run the server.

The first time you run the container it will setup the environment and defaults for the server, watch for it to tell you the mysql and admin passwords!

When you're in the container you should have a ~/.my.cnf setup which allows you to easily talk to the mysql sever with the mysql command line client.

All the local configuration is in workspace/Core3/MMOCoreORB/bin/conf/config-local.lua

#### Compile the server

Inside the container type:

```
build
```

#### Run the server

Inside the container type:

```
run
```

## Windows Subsystem for Linux Setup

There is an automated setup available for Windows 10+ with WSL.

See [wsl2/README.md](wsl2/README.md) for instructions.

## Linux Automated Setup

You can use the automated linux setup if you plan to run the server in a vm or dedicated cloud or metal server.

See [linux/README.md](linux/README.md) for instructions.

## Linux Manual Build

### Dependencies
  * Debian 12
  * CMake 3.18.0+
  * BerkeleyDB 5.3
  * MariaDb Client and Server
  * OpenSSL libraries
  * pthreads
  * Lua 5.3 libraries
  * Zlib libraries
  * clang 17
  * java runtime
  * boost

#### Clang-17

The easiest way to get the clang17 to build with is to use the script provided by the llvm repo:

```
sudo -i
apt-get install -y apt-transport-https ca-certificates git gnupg lsb-release moreutils software-properties-common wget
wget -O /tmp/llvm.sh https://apt.llvm.org/llvm.sh
chmod +x /tmp/llvm.sh
/tmp/llvm.sh 17 all
(set +x;cd /usr/bin;for i in ../lib/llvm-*/bin/*; do ln -sfv $i .; done)
clang --version
ld.lld --version
exit
```

This will install the latest and symlink all the files to /usr/bin so CMake finds them etc.

### Build

  * Install dependencies (Debian 12)

        sudo apt install build-essential liblua5.3-dev libdb5.3-dev libssl-dev cmake git default-jre libboost-all-dev

  * Clone core3 repository somewhere  (~/workspace)

        mkdir -p ~/workspace
        cd ~/workspace
        git clone https://review.swgemu.com/Core3

  * Build Core3

        cd Core3/MMOCoreORB
        make -j$(nproc)

  * Import sql database into mariadb

        sudo apt-get install mariadb-server
        Setup MariaDB User, database and import sql/swgemu.sql

### How to Run

    cd ~/workspace/Core3/MMOCoreORB/bin
    ./core3
