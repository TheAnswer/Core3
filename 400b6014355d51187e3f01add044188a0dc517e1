I did this because I didn\u0027t want to have to update every call of the method in every screen play with a new boolean argument. With the checkArgumentCount in place I wasn\u0027t sure if it would have been possible to have optional arguments.\n\nIf there\u0027s a better way to do this, I\u0027m open to suggestions.",
