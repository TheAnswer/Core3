I think it should be the scan_greeting_ strings that are broadcast here within this else {} (we see it in the non-mounted screen but not the mounted one).\n\nI think these contraband_scan_ strings should only be sent when the player is mounted. The non-mounted screen doesn\u0027t include them and the mounted one includes probe_scan which is very similar to these two.",
