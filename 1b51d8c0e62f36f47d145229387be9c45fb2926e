      "message": "Yep you might be right but when i originally had it with a single \u0027\u0026\u0027 , it ended up setting EVERY single crafted item to \u0027invulnerable\u0027 lol .  So i changed it and bingo it worked correctly in-game during testing.  However, you may very well be correct. (It\u0027s possible i had something else written wrong though, which caused that blanket bug) .  I\u0027ll wait til our Lead-Dev reviews it first and see what he says about it all before i start messing with it again.",
