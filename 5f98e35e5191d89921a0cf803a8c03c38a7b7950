By sending it here, there will be spam anytime someone is wounded, regardless of whether it was from combat or not.\n\nI\u0027ve not researched it, but some situations that I think may not be appropriate to send the spam (but would with this patch) include a medic wounding them self by using /tendwound or /tenddamage, group members getting re-wounded as a squad leader redistributes them with /boostmorale, the wounds incurred by a tk using /forceofwill, the wounds incurred when an artisan samples radioactive, and the wounds incurred from cloning.",
