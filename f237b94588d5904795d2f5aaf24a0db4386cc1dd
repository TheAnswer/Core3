      "message": "The value of the stat on the dna template is based upon where the dna sample value (the total of the contributions from each of the 5 slots) fits within a range, from approx 60% to 85%. The higher the sample value the greater the percentage.\n\nThe reason I\u0027m converting from one range to another is to fit with the SharedLabratory.cpp::getAssemblyPercentage function. This function returns the value we want for the dna template, divided by 1000. This value is then multiplied by 1000 in the CraftingValues::recalculateValues function.\n\nAs an example, if the combined dna samples give a value of 800.\n\ninitialValue: (800 - 1 / (900 - 1)) * (1800 - 300) + 300 \u003d 1633\n\ngetAssemblyPercentage: (1633 * (0.000015 * 1633 + 0.015) * 0.01 \u003d 0.645\n\nrecalculateValues (line 102): (0.645 * (1000 - 0) + 0) \u003d 645\n\nThis gives a template value of 645, approx 80% of the original value of 800.\n\nI hope that\u0027s a clear enough explanation, the above code is kicked off in the GeneticLabratory::setInitialCraftingValues function on line 258.",
