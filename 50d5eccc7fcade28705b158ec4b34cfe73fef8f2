      "message": "Yes, they don\u0027t match. According to http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Federation_of_the_Double_Worlds , Fed-dub \"was independent of the central government on Corellia, and often maintained adversarial relationships with the other planets of the system.\" I wouldn\u0027t mix them because they\u0027d be unlikely to work together. Since this takes place on Talus, it\u0027s likely that it was actually the Fed-Dub that were after him. The npc\u0027s breech string even says \"Fed-Dub officer! Give up!\" We can just assume that green laser was mixed up or wasn\u0027t really sure who it was that was on his trail.",
