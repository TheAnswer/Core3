      "message": "Seems odd to return at the first spawn with a disabled zone. You might still get some mobs spawned on zones that are enabled, but not necessarily all of them. I think it would be better to change it back to how it was (nesting the spawning within an if isZoneEnabled check) so that all mobs on enabled zones will spawn. If you want to print an error you can do that in the else.\n\nActually, a better option would be to traverse the map once building a table with each zone used in the quest and check if they are all enabled before spawning any of the npcs. If any are disabled, return and spawn no mobs.",

      "message": "Similar to what I mentioned on the epic quests, I don\u0027t really like returning at the first disabled zone. I think a themepark should spawn all or none of the mobs.\n\nPerhaps we can add a requiredPlanets table to quests that need more than one and traverse it first to make sure they are all enabled. If that table is empty, just check if self.planetName is enabled. I would probably do those within the start function before calling spawnNpcs. Then you can dispense with the isZoneEnabled checks within the loops in each of the functions currently called from start. If you do this, you can remove the checks from the custom functions in the epic quests as well.",
