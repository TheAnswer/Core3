      "message": "I see what you\u0027re going for here, but it has a potential for a few issues. You aren\u0027t checking which npc is being spawned, so you could end up renaming secondary NPC\u0027s. You\u0027re going to want to do a check against the spawn number to make sure its only the primary spawn. Something like:\n\nlocal npcName\nif (spawnNumber \u003d\u003d 1) then\n local playerID \u003d CreatureObject(pConversingPlayer):getObjectID()\n npcName \u003d readStringData(playerID  .. \":missionSpawn:mainNpcName\")\n deleteStringData(playerID  .. \":missionSpawn:mainNpcName\")\nend\n\nAfter that block, you can do your npcName \u003d\u003d \"\" block as normal.\n\nYou need to make sure you always delete any data you store in memory with writeStringData/writeData after you\u0027re done with it, otherwise it takes up memory until a restart.",
