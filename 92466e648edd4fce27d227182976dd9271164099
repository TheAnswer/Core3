Instead of using the survey observer from survey quests, you need to make one for sampling. When they sample in a spot with a high enough density, then you can give the special resource, though I\u0027m not sure it should be given automatically with the first sample.\n\nBased on the language in the strings (\"Once you get there, take a sample and try to find some special resources.\"), it seems to me like it should be a chance on sample to get the special resource so it might take them a bit to actually find it.",
