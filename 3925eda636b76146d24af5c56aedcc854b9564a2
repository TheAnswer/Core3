It makes no sense.\n\nFirst of all, why try and trigger a unique reaction message when the ai is dead if sendReactionChat is just going to return and do nothing if they are dead (your addition below)? \n\nSecond, NONE is not a valid reaction chat type. NONE is a state and has a value of 0 which is equal to the reaction type ALERT.",
