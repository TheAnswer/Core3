      "message": "If I\u0027m reading things correctly, I think this patch would only partially fix the problem. Yes, if a player logs off and then back on the quest will fail. It won\u0027t fix cases where the server goes down while a player has a quest active since the observer isn\u0027t persistent.\n\nAlso, I see where the observers are created in Task:start but they don\u0027t seem to ever be dropped. We should probably be dropping them in Task:finish.",
