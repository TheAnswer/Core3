      "message": "Move all this back into setWounds and have it use inflictDamage() instead of setHAM. That\u0027s a much cleaner way to handle it. Keep using the old addWounds function, this new one isn\u0027t necessary (because there\u0027s no case where you wouldn\u0027t want wounding to incap that isn\u0027t universal, ie, max HAM \u003d\u003d 1).",
