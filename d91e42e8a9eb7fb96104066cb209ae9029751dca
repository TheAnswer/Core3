      "message": "I think we should revise how we use the screenplay states for this quest. A player can only begin the quest if they have neither state set. They can quit it and start it over if they\u0027ve not completed it. Once they\u0027ve completed it, the only way you have for them to reset it is to join victor\u0027s campaign. This presents a problem because someone who completes this quest then misses the next phase 1 will not be able to do this quest again when the next phase 2 comes around.\n\nMy proposal for solving this is to use a different key for the state for each election cycle which you can do by appending the election number to the key (\"bestine_tusken_quest\" .. electionNum). This will ensure that anyone can start the quest from scratch each time a new phase 2 comes around.",
