      "message": "I don\u0027t think this formula really works given what the guide says (though I wish we had access to his raw data).\n\nI might have done something more like the following:\n\nint vitalityLost \u003d controlDevice-\u003egetMaxVitality() - controlDevice-\u003egetVitality();\n\nint vitalityLoss \u003d 1;\n\nif (effectiveness \u003c 45)\n      vitalityLoss +\u003d (vitalityLost / 8) + (vitalityLost / 12);\n} else if (effectiveness \u003c 75) {\n      vitalityLoss +\u003d (vitalityLost / 18) + (vitalityLost / 27);\n} else {\n      vitalityLoss +\u003d (vitalityLost / 28) + (vitalityLost / 42);\n}\n\nvitalityLoss *\u003d ((vitalityLost - 1) / effectiveness) + 1;\n\nIt\u0027s certainly more complicated and could use further refinement, but I think this would capture the gist of what the guide says, especially the ranges given and what the author says in the following:\n\n\"Q: What should I do if my pet loses a LOT of vitality (30+)?\n\nA: My suggestion would be to get the highest vitality pack you can find. Once you go beyond the ideal range for vitality packs, the permanent loss scales upward in a nonlinear fashion, and can get very large if you exceed the power of the vitpack. See the raw data for more info.\"",
