Observer doesn\u0027t inherit from SceneObject so casting to SceneObject will always result in a NULL object.\n\nSince Observer doesn\u0027t seem to have a method for database destruction already and it\u0027s in the engine, you\u0027ll need to talk to TA about what needs to be done. You may be able to just call ZoneServer::destroyObjectFromDatabase(oid), but double check with TA. He would know better than I.",
