      "message": "Only 1 of these is a posture. The other two are states.\n\nAlert state (applied by meditating) and swimming state both prevent conceal from being used. That happens in the checkStateMask call above so these two checks would never be true.\n\nProne would be included in the locomotion check above except that the data in the client command table says that prone is an acceptable locomotion to be in. Therefore it\u0027s possible that your isProne check could be true, but adding it contradicts the client. What evidence do you have for adding it? I didn\u0027t see any in the mantis.",
