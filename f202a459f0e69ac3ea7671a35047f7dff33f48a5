      "message": "Use a different variable name so it doesn\u0027t conflict with one you changed to 1000 above.\n\nAlso, why are you passing 250 to this method instead of mindCost?\n\nAdditionally, you should be doing this before you check if a player has enough mind. As of this patch set, if the base cost is 1000 and the adjusted cost is 500 and the player has 800 mind, they\u0027d be unable to use the command since their min is lower than the baseCost.",
