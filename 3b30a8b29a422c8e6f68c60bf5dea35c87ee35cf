      "message": "Directly iterating the inventory is added in patchset 3. I had adapted some code from getInsurableItems and missed the unnecessary looping over all slotteditems.\n\nRegarding recursivness, the RepairTool SUI feature explicitly only works on items in the player\u0027s immediate inventory, so I don\u0027t need recursiveness for now. Since this PlayerManager method is generic, I changed the method name to be more descriptive. It\u0027s only used by my new repair code for now, but I think it\u0027s still a useful method to have.",
